# Smiley-Face-
This is a simple web project that displays a smiley face using only basic HTML and CSS. It demonstrates the use of HTML for structure and CSS for styling and positioning elements. The smiley consists of a circular yellow face, two eyes, and a curved mouth, all styled with pure CSS without any images or external libraries.
